## 🔍 Overview  
The *Celebrity Face Generator* is an AI-powered application that creates synthetic celebrity-like faces. It utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model to generate high-quality images.  

---

## ⚙ Setup & Installation  

### ➡ Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd celebrity-face-generator
```

### ✅ Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)  
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 💾 Install Dependencies  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🌐 Run the Application  
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## 🚀 Usage Instructions  
1. Open the deployed Streamlit app in your browser.
2. Click on the **Generate Face** button to create a synthetic celebrity face.
3. Adjust model parameters if applicable.
4. Download or save the generated image.

## 🌍 Deployment Process  

### Step 1: Train and Save the Model  
- Train the model on the dataset.
- Save it as a `.h5` or `.pkl` file in the project directory.

### Step 2: Create a Streamlit App  
- The main application logic is in `app.py`.
- Ensure the script correctly loads the trained model and generates outputs.

### Step 3: Push the Project to GitHub  
Ensure your project includes:
- ✅ `app.py` (Main application script)
- ✅ `requirements.txt` (Dependencies)
- ✅ `README.md` (Documentation)
- ✅ Trained model file

Push your project to GitHub using:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Deploy on Streamlit Cloud  
1. Go to **Streamlit Cloud**.
2. Create a new app and connect your GitHub repository.
3. Select `app.py` as the entry point.
4. Click **Deploy** and wait for it to go live!

📌 **Make sure the deployed app is publicly accessible.**
